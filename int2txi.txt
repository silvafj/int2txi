 What is It?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Int2Txi is a converter that converts, the famous, Ralph Brown's Interrupt
List to Texinfo format, that then is converted to Info format with makeinfo.
    The final info files can be viewed with RHIDE InfoViewer, DJGPP Info or
with SET's Editor.

 How to Install?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This distribution includes the binary file and the source files.
    So, you have just to do:

        unzip i2txi120.zip     or   pkunzip -d i2txi120.zip

    in your DJGPP directory.

 How to Use?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Create a directory where you should put *ALL* Interrupt List files,
    including a file called "COMBINE.COM".
    You should have be installed "Makeinfo" too. This file will convert
    from Texinfo to Info format.
    If you have also "GZip" installed it will be used to compress the final
    info files.

    Simply type:

                  Int2Txi [options]

    Use the -h option for command line help.
    Use the -i option for software license.
    Use the -s option to start the convertion.
    Use the -m option to use makeinfo (if present in the system)
    Use the -g option to use gzip (if present in the system)

    The convertion takes about 20 minutes (10 minutes Int2Txi and 10 minutes
    Makeinfo).
    The final files will be : "INT2TXI.TXI" is the file created by Int2Txi,
    and if you choose "-m" option, the program will also run makeinfo to
    create the final info files, they are about 180 files RBINxxx. You need
    to put all this info files on you DJGPP\Info directory.
    The use of this files requires that you already know how to access Info
    files.

    The symbols that appear when Int2Txi is converting a file are :
      * the name of the file being processed
      * the numbers are the corrent interrupt being processed
      * '_' means that the program is checking all topics and it's creting
        a menu
      * '.' means that data it's being transfered

 History
 ~~~~~~~
    v1.0.0  1998. 06. 01
    ====================
      - Original release.

    v1.1.0  1998. 07. 01
    ====================
      - The name changed from Int2TeX to Int2Txi because it's the right one.
      - The convertion algorithm was corrected. Now it converts all topics.
      - The speed was also incresed. Now it's about 25% faster.
      - Some annoying situations, as some fatal errors, when some files were
        missing, were corrected.

 Things to do
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   + Use memory access for faster convertion, and do more work with less time.
   + Make more cross references. Actually I only have cross references to
     tables.
   - Actually I'm using disk access for temporary files.

    - Things to delete

 Known bugs or problems
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Problem  : When viewing the info file with RHIDE, there are some nodes
              where RHIDE freezes.
   Solution : That happens if you are using RHIDE version 1.4, with the new
              version 1.4.5 that doesn't happen anymore

   Problem  : When the program run "makeinfo" and starts the convertion from
              TeXinfo to Info format, it aborts and says that there is no
              memory available.
  Solution  : Yes, it's true. To resolve this you can do two things, or you
              buy more RAM, or you run "Int2Txi" in DOS (not DOS prompt) and
              not inside Windows.

   Problem  : When converting the list there are various files that are
              missing.
  Solution  : Int2Txi was made based on RBList 56, so if you don't have
              release 56 or later, you should get one.
              You should also check if you copied ALL RBList files to one
              directory.
