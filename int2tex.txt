 What is It?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Int2TeX is a converter that converts, the famous, Ralph Brown's Interrupt
List to TeXInfo format, that then is converted to Info format with makeinfo.
    The final info files can be viewed with RHIDE InfoViewer, DJGPP Info or
with SET's Editor.

 How to Install?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This distribution includes the binary file and the source files.
    So, you have just to do:

        unzip i2tex100.zip     or   pkunzip -d i2tex100.zip

    in your DJGPP directory.

 How to Use?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Create a directory where you should put *ALL* Interrupt List files,
    including a file called "Combine.COM".
    You should have be installed "MakeInfo" too. This file will convert
    from TeXInfo to Info format.

    Simply type:

                  Int2TeX [options]

    Use the -h option for command line help.
    Use the -i option for software license.
    Use the -s option to start the convertion.
    Use the -d option to delete and activate the deletion of ALL redundant and
    temporary files.

    The convertion takes about 30 minutes (15 minutes Int2TeX and 15 minutes
    MakeInfo).
    The final files will be 2. "Int2TeX.TEX" is the file created by Int2Tex,
    and "IntInfo.INF" is the final file created by MakeInfo. You should put
    this file on you DJGPP\Info directory.
    The use of this file requires that you already know how to access Info
    files.

 Things to do
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   + Use memory access for faster convertion.
   - Actually I'm using disk access for temporary files.
   + Make more cross references.
   * Actually I only have cross references to tables.

 Known bugs or problems
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Problem  : When viewing the info file with RHIDE, there are some nodes
              where RHIDE freezes.
   Solution : That happens if you are using RHIDE version 1.4, with the new
              version 1.4.5 that doesn't happen anymore

   Problem  : When the program run "makeinfo" and starts the convertion from
              TeXinfo to Info format, it aborts and says that there is no
              memory available.
  Solution  : Yes, it's true. To resolve this you can do two things, or you
              buy more RAM, or you run "int2TeX" in DOS (not DOS prompt) and
              not inside Windows.
